## Introduction

tldr; I like to use all the trendy stuff.

## OS-Enhancers

1. [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace). I use it because it
   lets me switch between workspaces instantly. I never really have two
   windows on the same workspace at once.
1. [Raycast](https://raycast.com/). I use it because MacOS Spotlight is
   depressingly slow. Raycast works instantly. Additionally, having an
   OS-level command palette is very convenient. I wish their AI features
   were decent.
1. [Karabiner-Elements](jjtps://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/). I use it to
   create a hyper key âœ¦ and to use vim bindings everywhere.

## Productivity

1. [Dia Browser](https://www.diabrowser.com/) or whichever one of The Browser Company's
   products isn't currently dead. Using AI to automatically organize tabs and
   automatically rename downloaded files to human-readable names is great.

## Dev Tools

1. [Zed](https://zed.dev/). It's like if Neovim was decent. I probably lose
   nerd credit for using it instead of Neovim.
1. [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/). At Meta, we used a tool just like it.
   Every day I wake up screaming and crying because I don't get to use it anymore.
   Graphite is my rebound.
1. [Flox](https://flox.dev/) (Alternatively [DevBox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/)).
   They basically give you all the benefits of using Nix but you fortunately don't
   have to directly deal with Nix. It's a far better devenv solution than [Dev
   Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
1. [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/). I used to use Warp, but I've come to realize
   Warp's features just get in the way.

## CLI Tools

I don't use anything particularly unique here.

1. [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (better `cat`)
1. [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) (better `ls`)
1. [tldr](https://github.com/ahmetb/tldr) (better `man`)
1. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (just better)
1. [envio](https://envio-cli.github.io/quick-start) because I'm just sick of typing `export KEY=...`

## Themes

I don't make my own themes. I steal themes from
[catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) and use a [script](scripts/steal)
to map the colors from pastel purple to my own color palette.
