## Introduction

tldr; I like to use all the trendy stuff.

## OS-Enhancers

1. [Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace). I use it because it
   lets me switch between workspaces instantly.
2. [Raycast](https://raycast.com/). I use it because MacOS Spotlight is
   depressingly slow. Raycast works instantly. Additionally, having an
   OS-level command palette is very convenient.
3. [Karabiner-Elements](jjtps://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/). I use it to
   create a hyper key âœ¦ and to use vim bindings everywhere.

## Productivity

1. [Arc Browser](https://arc.net/) or whichever one of The Browser Company's
   products isn't currently dead. Using AI to automatically organize tabs and
   automatically rename downloaded files to human-readable names is great.
2. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Everyone wants to be a notes app. Arc
   had a build-in notes app that was sunset relatively fast. Warp has a built-in
   notes app that I don't trust to last. Vanilla markdown in a git repository is
   the only way.

## Dev Tools

1. [Zed](https://zed.dev/). It's like if Neovim was decent. I probably lose
   nerd credit for using it instead of Neovim.
2. [Graphite](https://graphite.dev/). At Meta, we used a tool just like it.
   Every day I wake up screaming and crying because I don't get to use it anymore.
   Graphite is my rebound.
3. [Flox](https://flox.dev/) (Alternatively [DevBox](https://www.jetify.com/devbox/)).
   They basically give you all the benefits of using Nix but you fortunately don't
   have to directly deal with Nix. It's a far better devenv solution than [Dev
   Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).
4. [Warp](https://warp.dev/). I mostly use Zed's built-in terminal, but
   Warp has the best UX out of all standalone terminals.

## CLI Tools

I don't use anything particularly unique here.

1. [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (better `cat`)
2. [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) (better `ls`)
3. [tldr](https://github.com/ahmetb/tldr) (better `man`)
4. [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) (better `cd`)
5. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (just better)

## Themes

I don't make my own themes. I steal themes from
[catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin) and use a [script](scripts/steal)
to map the colors from pastel purple to my own color palette.
